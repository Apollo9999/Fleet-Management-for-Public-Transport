# Fleet-Management-for-Public-Transport

The Objective of the project is to create and design a system which solves problems faced by the Indian public transport system revolves around the unwillingness of the users to opt for public transport. One of the most important, yet easily unnoticed, aspects about fleet management is preventative care and maintenance. It's not the quality of a vehicle's build that causes a premature demise, but rather improper maintenance. Given a lot of fleet data, our team would analyze it, so we can promote a more pro-active, instead of reactive, approach to maintenance, thus ultimately saving a company money and preventing unnecessary waste.

Explanation of the project

A user can log into the app and check up on their fleet of vehicles. The user can add new vehicle by simply scanning the QR code containing vehicle number .From there, a python script manipulated the data given to find vehicles that need service/maintenance. The app will then tell the user which vehicles need what service, and the user can easily locate what vehicles need service by using augmented reality and location data! It chiefly takes into consideration the work laod over engine to compute the next required service check but also the other two main features are that it will use the latitude longitude data along with timestamp to check for weather log at that day, and also it would leverage the location data to find out terrain of the location. The weather and terrain form two important factor alongside of mileage/fuel efficiency of vehicle these all parameters are taken into consideration to find out when is next maintenance required and what type of maintenance is required. Based on location it suggests the nearest service station at the time of required maintenance.

public transport is not maintained with proper hygiene which discourages a large proportion of the commuters from using them.

. public transport Fleet management is all about keeping costs reasonable, maximizing profitability, and minimizing risk.



Our solution: We propose the development of a The python script communicates to the app by a firebase database. The authentication is also done from firebase. We used a t-test to find what vehicles need maintenance. which can be used to record every detail pertaining to a vehicle. The details may include the date of purchase, tire condition, engine oil status, etc. As a result, the user is provided with a complete history of the vehicle, thereby allowing him to make more informed choices.

The novelty of idea: Real-time monitoring of vehicle health. Novel and flawless use of Blockchain. Transparent Highly Secure

We believe that our solution will urge people to use public transport and also it serves as a monitoring mechanism for authorities to maintain public transport better.

Dealing with a lot of data was difficult as it caused for very long run times just to work with the data.

Qualitative Accomplishments

We managed to find vehicles that needed maintenance and present that in a very user-friendly way! We also learned a lot about data analysis techniques and managed to work efficiently as a team the whole time.
